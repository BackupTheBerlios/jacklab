Welcome Earthling!

This is the jacklab gentoo overlay containing pro-audio software and libs that
are not in official portage.

DISCLAIMER:

Parts of this overlay contain highly experimental software. USE WITH CARE!
Do NOT blame us or even worse the gentoo developers if using these ebuilds
causes your computer to explode, your cat violently attacs you, your girlfriend
tells you to STFUAPOA or god knows what else.


USAGE:

- first checkout the overlay with

	$ cd /usr/local/overlays
	$ cvs -d ":pserver:anonymous@cvs.jacklab.berlios.de:/cvsroot/jacklab"  co -P -d "jacklab-overlay" "gentoo"

- add the overlay to /etc/make.conf. For info on how to do so, please refer to
