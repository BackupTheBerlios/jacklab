Welcome Earthling!

ABOUT:

This is the jacklab gentoo overlay containing pro-audio software and libs that
are not in official portage.
The ebuilds come from different sources: some of them are written by gimpel,
lots of them are from evermind's superb pro-audio overlay which can be found
here: http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-427211.html

DISCLAIMER:

Parts of this overlay contain highly experimental software. USE WITH CARE!
Do NOT blame us or even worse the gentoo developers if using these ebuilds
causes your computer to explode, your cat violently attacs you, your girlfriend
tells you to STFUAPOA or god knows what else.


USAGE:

1.) first checkout the overlay with

  $ cd /usr/local/overlays
  $ cvs -d ":pserver:anonymous@cvs.jacklab.berlios.de:/cvsroot/jacklab"  co -P -d "jacklab-overlay" "gentoo"
  
  Note that you maybe have to create the dir /usr/local/overlays first
  
2.) add the overlay to /etc/make.conf. For info on how to do so, please refer to
http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Installing_3rd_Party_Ebuilds

3.) to update the overlay:

  $ cd /usr/local/overlays/jacklab-overlay
  $ cvs up -dP


TROUBLE?

From time to time it might happen that you get things like "digest verification failed" or similar.
This is because someone forgot to re-digest the ebuild after commiting changes. Just cd in the
directory of the ebuild ("foo" in the example) and do:

  $ ebuild foo.ebuild digest
